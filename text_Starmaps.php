<h5>Castelfield Gallery 1993</h5>
<p>...in the recent paintings it becomes obvious that Hall has shifted her method. Instead of imposing a whole outlined oneness of intention upon the canvas she builds up a further layering of possible evidence through her working method. Instead of dealing absolutely by answering a question that could never be posed through painting she approaches the country's imperial past through a fragmented accumulation of drawing. An alternately faltering and fast line hints at recognisable images. These can be attractive, decisive and unclear all at the same time. This faltering and questioning thought process has by necessity lead to the rejection of a display of false clarity of vision. In the same way that Gerhard Richter paints the blur in order to show how both the personal and photographic memory are ungraspable and unreliable, Hall dissects and crosses the surface with a build up of delicate delineation.</p>
<p>The relation between the process of thought and the activity of drawing is particularly naked here. By laying a trail across the canvas she describes a conceptual journey. The solid ground of so many 'clear' historical narratives has been replaced by an active involvment. The soil has been loosened and disrupted. New territories are explored.</p>

<p>In the star map paintings, the night sky becomes an arena for the projection of images which have now largely lost their meaning, and where we see representations of the major constellations together with elemental divinities and personages associated with fate (many of these relate to early navigational systems and the ‘age of discovery’); their presentation is often extremely fragmented and optically dissolved by the close toned harmonies. In a similar manner territorial maps are used for the painting ’Traces’ ,an almost total subversion of the original is achieved by re- using the image several times, and, by pushing the representation to its limit, it seemingly passes over into complete abstraction. These might be seen as the key to the new paintings, in the sense that we are deflected from any literal reading of the images because they are shattered through the very endeavour of the paintings, which force us to attend to so many other things. What is being presented is not the image as a carrier of meaning, but the possibility of representing an act of prohibition.</p>
