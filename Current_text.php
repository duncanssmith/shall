<h6>Review by David Lillington October 1990</h6>
<p>...Political issues are raised in her work, particularly that of the social position of women-but the ideas which communicate most are about the language of art. Hall speaks of presenting her images as ‘signs’ open to new narrative readings’. This isn’t as esoteric as it sounds: in the paintings you are well aware of looking at an old visual language translated into a new one-sixteenth century alphabet pictures meet abstraction…..</p>

<p>...Single elements from diverse narratives stand frozen contiguous, spatial compartments, each replicating the formal vocabulary of the wood block(using horizontal hatching and reversals of light and dark).Halls paintings propose a narrative existing in space rather than time-non linear and non developmental. This spatialisation, of a story can be seen to correspond to a structuralist model of language, where the grid, like the sentence, can be extended ad infinitum, and where meaning is continuously deferred through a system of shifting difference...</p>

<p>The canvases are painted in delicate concoctions of colour: lavender- blues, rose-pinks, and pea-greens, for instance. Paint is dragged across the surface vertically and horizontally, so that one is reminded of microscopic enlargements of woven silk.The twist lies in the spidery line drawings that float atop these striated backgrounds….</p>

<h5>Starmaps and Follies</h5>
<h6>Castelfield Gallery 1993</h6>
<p>...in the recent paintings it becomes obvious that hall has shifted her method. Instead of imposing a whole outlined oneness of intention upon the canvas she builds up a further layering of possible evidence through her working method. Instead of dealing absolutely by answering a question that could never be posed through painting she approaches the country’s imperial past through a fragmented accumulation of drawing. An alternately faltering and fast line hints at recognisable images. These can be attractive, decisive and unclear all at the same time. This faltering and questioning thought process has by necessity lead to the rejection of a display of false clarity of vision. In the same way that Gerhard Richter paints the blur in order to show how both the personal and photographic memory are ungraspable and unreliable, Hall dissects and crosses the surface with a build up of delicate delineation.</p>
<p>The relation between the process of thought and the activity of drawing is particularly naked here. By laying a trail across the canvas she describes a conceptual journey. The solid ground of so many’clear’historical narratives has been replaced by an active involvment.The soil has been loosened and disrupted. New territories are explored.</p>

<p>The basic organising principle in the paintings of Sharon Hall is the grid. This is very clearly defined as an all-over colour charged lattice which mechanically fills the available area. The effect of the grid is to reinforce, even to the point of over emphasis, the finite planar character of painting itself, measuring out the full extension of the surface without remainder, to mark exactly the limits of the constructed pictorial field….to use a grid is to commit to abstraction and artifice, and set certain conditions which influence the other elements which the painting may contain, in particular those that come into conflict with the disciplined division of the canvas.</p>
<p>In Hall’s work the dissident component is a looping meandering which seems at first o have escaped the grids influence entirely, to roam casually and unhindered across the surface. However though it emerges as an expressive agent, its progress improvised intuitively to follow the path of a rhizoid growth within a schematic system; it nevertheless registers a response to its context. Instead of being the grids opposite it assumes something of a schematic character itself, becoming in places partly decorative, or ornamental, in the musical sense, as it is wrought into baroque arabesques and curlicues which intersperse the looser linear sweeps.
