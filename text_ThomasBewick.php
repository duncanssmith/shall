<h5>Sharon Hall, Anna Miszewska, New Work</h5>
<h6>Ferens Gallery, Hull, 1989</h6>
<p>In Sharon Hall's recent work popular alternative imagery from the past is located within surfaces created from fields of horizontal lines reminiscent of those of minimalist painters such as Agnes Martin and Robert Ryman. The disjunctive effect of the juxtaposition of two such widely different idioms is lessened because the surfaces themselves are ambiguous. On the one hand, because of the nature of the image, they can be seen to allude to the texture of wood grain in wood block printing; on the other hand they appear to have been created from controlled, but simple autonomous mark making. This characteristic of imagery emerging out of or relating to, the procedures and practises of minimal art has been a dominant feature of some of the most interesting and widely known British sculpture of the 80's, the work of Tony Cragg, Bill Woodrow and David Mach for example, but it has hardly been a feature of painting of the same period... The subjects relate to the theme of 'the world turned upside down' and again obliquely refer to the state of contemporary society. However these are not didactic works; the imagery is important but the paintings themselves are about the spaces, ambiguities and shifting readings that are generated when very different pictorial systems are juxtaposed.</p>
