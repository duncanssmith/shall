<h2>1995, Mark Durden, <i>The Borrowed Image</i>, exhibition review, Art Monthly June 1995</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Sharon Hall drags up our colonial past. Her paintings copy 400 year old watercolours made during Sir Walter Raleigh's expedition to the new world: picture which mapped the landscape, show fortified encampments and illustrate what were then such exotic and fantastic creatures as an alligator. Hall's copyings are in the form of fragmentary details which only partly fill her canvases; the rest is filled by an abstract surface made up of linear cross-hatched markings. A 'bad' part of our history contributes to these beautiful paintings; her critique is edged with an evident aesthetic fascination with this historical material.</p>
