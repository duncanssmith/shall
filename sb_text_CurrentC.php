The idea behind this project was for each of the painters to explore their practice in relation to the particularities of the given space and also the other works in the show.  It attempted to unfold different understandings of space and surface – as manufactured, projected, fractured etc., and might include the ‘economy ‘ of the single bounded painting to ensembles and installational events. One of the five painters for each proposed venue takes charge of overall curatorial possibilities – including the relationship of the works, the general shape of the installation, as well as the invitation for a critic or practitioner regarding an accompanying written text etc. (for example, in the last realization, at the Holden Gallery in Manchester, Sharon Hall took on this curatorial role.)

The exhibition explored various matrices of surface around abstraction, architecture, the body, intentionality and contingency.  It attempted to do this in a way which examined the relationship between work and space which was disruptive and interruptive (as opposed to any curatorially 'pure' presentation.)
