<h2>1990, David Lillington review of Rebecca Hossack exhibition, Time Out, October</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sharon Hall won the Rome Award this year, and judging by her recent work, showing here, it was for sheer intelligence. Hall makes her viewers work hard. Her Reversible World IV has an image (haystack chases horse) purloined from Breughel, drawn in paint and superimposed on an image (wife beats man) from a sixteenth century German playing card. The wife-beats-man image is set sideways. The whole is extremely difficult to read clearly; its interesting enough however to inspire the effort...</p>
<p>...Political issues are raised in her work, particularly that of the social position of women - but the ideas which communicate most are about the language of art. Hall speaks of presenting her images as 'signs' open to new narrative readings. This isn't as esoteric as it sounds: in the paintings you are well aware of looking at an old visual language translated into a new one: sixteenth century alphabet pictures meet abstraction...
