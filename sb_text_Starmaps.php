'To make her point, Hall is not satisfied with re-consuming contemporary media images, but rather, goes back to the root of the problem: the woodblock print, the mappings of the heavens and earth etc., yet this does not remain at the level of unmasking power-laden representations; the image is forced into its 'other' rather than simply stripped of its power; almost as though the project of abstraction was being explored in negative.'
