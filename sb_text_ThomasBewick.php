This series of works grew out of an interest in the technological advancement and improvement of illustrational techniques as was enabled through the early 19th century wood engravings of Thomas Bewick. Bewick's work contributed significantly to the development of a more precise definition of imagery in its more refined use of the cross section of the wood block as well as representing the artist wit and humour with typical succinctness. A parallel concern of these works was the echoing of the representational language of wood block printing through the grained use of the traced brushstroke and its conceptual doubling of real and historical 'time'.
