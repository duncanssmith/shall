This exhibition brings together new paintings by Fabian Peake and Sharon Hall. The artists have both decided on certain methods for the exhibition, which allow them to investigate ongoing concerns over the particular display of painting. This can be seen as a technique which is critical to the construction of the paintings themselves. As a technique it actualises different method for interaction, where the autonomy of a single surface - the physical constraints that this brings to painting - is shifted, subsequently enhancing the interconnectivity of the multiple panels. These different surfaces can be engaged, by the viewer, singularly but also across the constraints of the frame or  edge. Frame as a device, or shape, would usually construct the particulars of surface and, at the same time distinguishes the plane from anything outside. In contrast the more theatrical installation enhances the connections between the different surfaces. This method highlights difference and subjects each surface, not only to differences evident within its own surface but also differences created in the connections between the different surfaces.
