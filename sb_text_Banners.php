This series of paintings grew out of my interest in imagery which related to the early days of the trade unions and the Labour movement in England, together with the use of authentic, vernacular material, chosen for its visual beauty as well as political resonance. The works, which were literally banners, on unstretched canvases combined a variety of media. The ground of the piece is a silk-screened multiple of a trade union strike meeting of 1911; the second superimposed image a contemporary illustration of a cross section of the HMS Titanic and lastly the final layers are either an inverted beehive (a popular image of social hierarchy) or alternatively a repeated image of different commodities.
