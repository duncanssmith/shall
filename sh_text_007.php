<h2>1994, Robert Clark, review of Castelfield exhibition, The Guardian</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Sharon Hall's recent canvases are so odd and awkward I suspect they are much better than they at first appear. Although generally too airy to at all appeal to me, they nevertheless give me the kind of uncomfortable feelings that come from the viewing of truly adventurous work. In any case I've not seen a show quite like this anywhere before, and that's got to be a good thing... The work's unrelieved surreal dizziness should be disturbing but its not; its more light headed like a mind tingle of intoxication...</p>
