<h4>Gold Dust Pieces</h4>
<h5>Chisenhale Gallery May 1988</h5>
<p>The works in this show are a sub series of a larger project which is intended to cover the history of gold and the part it has played in the establishment of our present economic systems.</p>
<p>The work I had produced up until this point had often made use of prime source material in the form of old engravings and popular prints and in trying to fid a set of images to use for the gold series I stumbled across some colour reproductions in an old Time Life book of original watercolours made by the pioneers of the American gold rush in 1849.At this time I was also aware of a piece of music by the American contemporary composer, Christian Wolff entitled Star Dust Pieces which had also made use of vernacular source material in its construction and composition. Eventually and partly in” homage” to Wolff’s music I titled the whole series Gold Dust Pieces. Wolff s use of a grid structure to simultaneously present a complete but spatially fragmented image, together with its use of material which stood outside of mainstream high culture became one of the primary concerns of these works.</p>

1989
In Sharon Hall’s recent work popular ’alernative’ imagery from the past is located within surfaces created from fields of horizontal lines reminiscent of those of minimalist painters such as Agnes Martin and Robert Ryman. The disjunctive effect of the juxtaposition of two such widely different idioms is lessened because the surfaces themselves are ambiguous. On the one hand, because of the nature of the image, they can be seen to allude to the texture of wood grain in wood block printing; on the other hand they appear to have been created from controlled, but simple autonomous mark making. This characteristic of imagery emerging out of or relating to, the procedures and practises of minimal art has been a dominant feature of some of the most interesting and widely known British sculpture of the 80’s-the work of Tony Cragg. Bill Woodrow and David Mach for example, but it has hardly been a feature of painting of the same period…..The subject’s relate to the theme of ‘the world turned upside down’ and again obliquely refer to the state of contemporary society. However, these are not didactic works, the imagery is important but the paintings themselves are about the spaces, ambiguities and shifting readings that are generated when very different pictorial systems are juxtaposed

Recent Paintings
Rebecca Hossack Gallery London 1990
The work include d in the present exhibition can be seen as belonging to the following series in terms of their subject matter-works that draw on the iconography of the world turned upside down; a series that uses early educational material in the form of Catalogues and Primers; and a set of pieces which incorporate John White’s watercolours of one of the first British explorations of north America which are collectively titled Histories and Discoveries.
Each of these series has in common the procedural strategy of combining appropriated imagery juxtaposed with a highly formalised processual surface. The resulting effect of this juxtaposition creates a dialectical play between different signifying systems which in turn generate shifting and ambiguous readings……
The beauty of visual discourse is in its capacity to generate many interpretive levels, which in Halls case might embrace both the analytical and the sensual. The pictorial leaps of thought which her paintings invite create a kind of unsmooth clarity where both the archaeology of the past ant the opticality of the present begin to inform the artist’s relation to history in new and exciting ways

Review by David Lillington October 1990
…..Political issue are raised in her work, particularly that of the social position of women-but the ideas which communicate most are about the language of art. Hall speaks of presenting her images as ‘signs’ open to new narrative readings’. This isn’t as esoteric as it sounds: in the paintings you are well aware of looking at an old visual language translated into a new one-sixteenth century alphabet pictures meet abstraction…..

Review:
….Single elements from diverse narratives stand frozen contiguous, spatial compartments, each replicating the formal vocabulary of the wood block(using horizontal hatching and reversals of light and dark).Halls paintings propose a narrative existing in space rather than time-non linear and non developmental. This ‘spatialisation’, of a story can be seen to correspond to a structuralist model of language, where the grid, like the sentence, can be extended ad infinitum, and where meaning is continuously deferred through a system of shifting difference….

ROMA
Paintings
Union Street Gallery January 1994
Sharon Hall’s paintings remain difficult to categorise. On the one hand they explore a potential for narrative content through her use of imagery, while on the other, a deep rooted concern with purely optical and formal devices remains extremely important. These oppositions are set up in a variety of ways, sometimes in the one canvas or even related pieces within a series (the Roma series for instance where image and linear ground are separated out).Such a dialogue appears to explore the ‘forgetfulness’ of the modernist autonomous object, and the attempt to hold on to a possibility of retrieving some form of ‘truth content’ from the distant past. Where this is located is within the array of images, always seemingly fragmented or inconspicuous, yet painted with the belief that something can be unlocked…..

THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
The canvases are painted in delicate concoctions of colour: lavender- blues, rose-pinks, and pea-greens, for instance. Paint is dragged across the surface vertically and horizontally, so that one is reminded of microscopic enlargements of woven silk.The twist lies in the spidery line drawings that float atop these striated backgrounds….

STARMAPS AND FOLLIES
Castelfield Gallery 1993
…..in the recent paintings it becomes obvious that hall has shifted her method. Instead of imposing a whole outlined oneness of intention upon the canvas she builds up a further layering of possible evidence through her working method. Instead of dealing absolutely by answering a question that could never be posed through painting she approaches the country’s imperial past through a fragmented accumulation of drawing. An alternately faltering and fast line hints at recognisable images. These can be attractive, decisive and unclear all at the same time. This faltering and questioning thought process has by necessity lead to the rejection of a display of false clarity of vision. In the same way that Gerhard Richter paints the blur in order to show how both the personal and photographic memory are ungraspable and unreliable, Hall dissects and crosses the surface with a build up of delicate delineation.
The relation between the process of thought and the activity of drawing is particularly naked here. By laying a trail across the canvas she describes a conceptual journey. The solid ground of so many’clear’historical narratives has been replaced by an active involvment.The soil has been loosened and disrupted. New territories are explored.

STARMAPS AND FOLLIES

In the star map paintings, the night sky becomes an arena for the projection of images which have now largely lost their meaning, and where we see representations of the major constellations together with elemental divinities and personages associated with fate (many of these relate to early navigational systems and the ‘age of discovery’); their presentation is often extremely fragmented and optically dissolved by the close toned harmonies. In a similar manner territorial maps are used for the painting ’Traces’ ,an almost total subversion of the original is achieved by re- using the image several times, and, by pushing the representation to its limit, it seemingly passes over into complete abstraction. These might be seen as the key to the new paintings, in the sense that we are deflected from any literal reading of the images because they are shattered through the very endeavour of the paintings, which force us to attend to so many other things. What is being presented is not the image as a carrier of meaning, but the possibility of representing an act of prohibition.

STARMAPS AND FOLLIES

Sharon Hall’s recent canvases are so odd and awkward I suspect they are much better than they at first appear. Although generally too airy to at all appeal to me, they nevertheless give me the kind of uncomfortable feelings that come from the viewing of truly adventurous work. In any case I’ve not seen a show quite like this anywhere before, and that’s got to be a good thing…..The work’s unrelieved surreal dizziness should be disturbing but its not; its more light headed like a mind tingle of intoxication….
Robert Clark review of Castelfied exhibition - the Guardian


Through the intensely delicate marks, lines and fragments of freehand initiated wood cut trails; she translates the images in related clean colours from all directions, across painstaking blinds of line. She makes you investigate the truths only hinted at in initial viewing. A gorgeous fact of these paintings is that they make you watch them further, as if you might find a plough in the stars…..The stains and stitches of colour physically tighten your eye and brow, and you are constantly aware of the time involved in both making and emergence….
Sue Platt review of Castelfield exhibition-City Life 1994









HISTORIES

The Borrowed Image
Sunderland Centre for Contemporary Art 1995
Sharon Hall drags up our colonial past. Her paintings copy 400 year old watercolours made during Sir Walter Raleigh’s expedition to the new world: picture which mapped the landscape, show fortified encampments and illustrate what were then such exotic and fantastic creatures as an alligator. Hall’s copyings are in the form of fragmentary details which only partly fill her canvases; the rest is filled by an abstract surface made up of linear cross-hatched markings. A ‘bad’ part of our history contributes to these beautiful paintings; her critique is edged with an evident aesthetic fascination with this historical material.

The basic organising principle in the paintings of Sharon Hall is the grid. This is very clearly defined as an all-over colour charged lattice which mechanically fills the available area. The effect of the grid is to reinforce, even to the point of over emphasis, the finite planar character of painting itself, measuring out the full extension of the surface without remainder, to mark exactly the limits of the constructed pictorial field….to use a grid is to commit to abstraction and artifice, and set certain conditions which influence the other elements which the painting may contain, in particular those that come into conflict with the disciplined division of the canvas.
In Hall’s work the dissident component is a looping meandering which seems at first o have escaped the grids influence entirely, to roam casually and unhindered across the surface. However though it emerges as an expressive agent, its progress improvised intuitively to follow the path of a rhizoid growth within a schematic system; it nevertheless registers a response to its context. Instead of being the grids opposite it assumes something of a schematic character itself, becoming in places partly decorative, or ornamental, in the musical sense, as it is wrought into baroque arabesques and curlicues which intersperse the looser linear sweeps.
