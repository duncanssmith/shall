'...in Reversible World 1V, whilst lilac stitches on lilac, we follow the lines of a bale of hay chasing a horse from a Breughel engraving, The Hay Chasing the Horse. The man is chased again in the overlaid side view where a woman beats her husband. Comments on the role of women surface, although there a massive frustration in unravelling the images. The stains and stitches of colour physically tighten your eye and brow and you are constantly aware of the time involved in both making and emergence.'
