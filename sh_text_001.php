<h2>1990, David Ryan, Rebecca Hossack Gallery, catalogue essay</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The work included in the present exhibition can be seen as belonging to the following series in terms of their subject matter - works that draw on the iconography of the world turned upside down; a series that uses early educational material in the form of Catalogues and Primers; and a set of pieces which incorporate John White’s watercolours of one of the first British explorations of north America which are collectively titled Histories and Discoveries.</p>
<p>Each of these series has in common the procedural strategy of combining appropriated imagery juxtaposed with a highly formalised processual surface. The resulting effect of this juxtaposition creates a dialectical play between different signifying systems which in turn generate shifting and ambiguous readings...</p>
<p>The beauty of visual discourse is in its capacity to generate many interpretive levels, which in Halls case might embrace both the analytical and the sensual. The pictorial leaps of thought which her paintings invite create a kind of unsmooth clarity where both the archaeology of the past and the opticality of the present begin to inform the artist’s relation to history in new and exciting ways.</p>
