These works use cartoon imagery taken from the popular boy’s comics of <i>Billy Bunter's School Days</i> combined with older popular imagery derived from the folk tradition of the <i>World Turned Upside Down</i>. On the one hand the Bunter images might be seen to represent the English class system as would be evidenced through the public school culture and on the other, revolutionary imagery is depicted through the iconic tradition of symbolic role reversal and, in these particular works, anamorphic images of animals acting out human roles.
