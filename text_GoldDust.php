<h5>Chisenhale Gallery May 1988</h5>
<p>The works in this show are a sub series of a larger project which is intended to cover the history of gold and the part it has played in the establishment of our present economic systems.</p>
<p>The work I had produced up until this point had often made use of prime source material in the form of old engravings and popular prints and in trying to find a set of images to use for the gold series I stumbled across some colour reproductions in an old Time Life book of original watercolours made by the pioneers of the American gold rush in 1849. At this time I was also aware of a piece of music by the American contemporary composer, Christian Wolff, entitled <i>Star Dust Pieces</i>, which had also made use of vernacular source material in its construction and composition. Eventually, and partly in homage to Wolff's music, I entitled the whole series <i>Gold Dust Pieces</i>. Wolff's use of a grid structure to simultaneously present a complete but spatially fragmented image, together with its use of material which stood outside of mainstream high culture became one of the primary concerns of these works.</p>
